> **"It works on my machine... and it flows in my mind."**

## 📖 The Story: A Developer's Escape
**AuroraDash** is a high-fidelity, atmospheric endless runner inspired by the meditative vibes of *Alto's Adventure*.

We know the struggle: The sprint is ending, the `console` is full of red text, and burnout is creeping in. AuroraDash was built for that exact moment. It is a procedural winter sanctuary where you trade high-pressure deadlines for shimmering auroras and soothing soundscapes.

Steer your rubber-duck-powered sleigh through a world of `syntax errors` and `404` boulders. It isn't just a game; it's a rhythmic, chill escape designed to help developers find their "flow state."

## 🎮 Theme Interpretation: "Games o|x"
**Theme:** Architecting a game-themed experience.

We interpreted the theme by architecting a digital cure for developer fatigue.
* **Visual Architecture:** We engineered a custom rendering engine that prioritizes hypnotic, fluid motion (parallax snow, aurora gradients) to act as a visual palate cleanser.
* **The Metaphor:** The gameplay mirrors the developer experience. The obstacles are the bugs we fight daily, but the movement is the grace we strive for. We didn't just build a runner; we architected a **Zen Mode** for your browser.

## 🕹️ Gameplay Mechanics & Power-ups

Navigate the snowy terrain and use your developer toolkit to survive:

### ☕ The Boost: `Coffee`
> *Signifies: The Flow State*
Collecting a `Coffee` cup triggers a temporary speed boost. It simulates that caffeine-induced burst of productivity where code writes itself, allowing you to glide effortlessly past obstacles.

### 🛡️ The Protection: `Firewall`
> *Signifies: Security & Stability*
Picking up the shield item activates a `Firewall`. This protective layer wraps your character in a secure shell, allowing you to crash through exactly one `404 Boulder` or `Syntax Error` without breaking the build (ending the run).

### 👾 The Obstacles
* **`404` Boulders:** Large, immovable rocks representing missing resources.
* **Syntax Spikes:** Sharp coding errors that must be jumped over.

## 🚀 Tech Stack

We utilized a modern, type-safe stack to ensure performance and developer experience:

* **Frontend:** `React 18`, `TypeScript`, `Vite`
* **Game Engine:** `HTML5 Canvas API` (Custom implementation for fluid physics)
* **Styling:** `Tailwind CSS`
* **Animations:** `Framer Motion` (UI Transitions)
* **State Management:** `TanStack React Query`
* **Icons:** `Lucide React`
